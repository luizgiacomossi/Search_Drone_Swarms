## 🎮 Controls & Interface

- **Space:** Pause/Resume simulation
- **R:** Reset simulation
- **+/-:** Adjust simulation speed
- **ESC:** Exit simulator
- **Mouse Click:** Place target/obstacle

## 🔍 Search Strategies

The simulator includes several pre-implemented search strategies:

- **Grid Search** - Systematic coverage of the entire area
- **Spiral Search** - Outward spiraling pattern from central point
- **Random Walk** - Stochastic movement with collision avoidance
- **Levy Flight** - Bio-inspired search pattern with occasional long jumps

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `constants.py` to modify simulation parameters:

```python
# Simulation parameters
SIM_WIDTH = 1200         # Width of simulation window
SIM_HEIGHT = 800         # Height of simulation window
NUM_DRONES = 10          # Number of drones in swarm
OBSTACLE_DENSITY = 0.05  # Density of obstacles (0.0 to 1.0)

# Drone parameters
DRONE_SPEED = 3.0        # Maximum drone speed
SENSOR_RANGE = 100       # Drone sensor detection radius
COMMUNICATION_RANGE = 200  # Inter-drone communication range
```
